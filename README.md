# loadtest

Runs a load test on the selected HTTP URL. The API allows for easy integration in your own tests.

Why use `loadtest` instead of any other of the available tools, notably Apache `ab`?
`loadtest` allows you to configure and tweak requests to simulate real world loads.

The set of basic options are designed to be compatible with Apache `ab`.
But while `ab` can only set a concurrency level and lets the server adjust to it,
`loadtest` allows you to set a rate or requests per second with the `--rps` option.
Example:

    loadtest -c 10 --rps 200 http://mysite.com/

This command sends exactly 200 requests per second with concurrency 10,
so you can see how your server copes with sustained rps.
Even if `ab` reported a rate of 200 rps,
you will be surprised to see how a constant rate of requests per second affects performance:
no longer are the requests adjusted to the server, but the server must adjust to the requests!
Rps rates are usually lowered dramatically about 20~25% (in our example from 200 to 150 rps),
but the resulting figure is much more robust.

Using the provided API it is very easy to integrate loadtest with your package, and run programmatic load tests.
loadtest makes it very easy to run load tests as part of systems tests, before deploying a new version of your software.
The results include mean response times and percentiles, so that you can abort deployment e.g. if 99% of the requests don't finish in 10 ms or less.

## Changes in Version 1.0

* Option parsing has been improved; no longer is a `true` needed after certain options.
* Requests per second specified with `--rps` are now total rps, instead of multiplied by concurrency.
* Option `--agent` has been deprecated in favor of `--keepalive`.
* Support for Node.js < 0.10 removed.

## Installation

Install globally as root:

    # npm install -g loadtest

On Ubuntu or Mac OS X systems install using sudo:

    $ sudo npm install -g loadtest

For access to the API just add package `loadtest` to your `package.json` devDependencies:

    {
        ...
        "devDependencies": {
            "loadtest": "*"
        },
        ...
    }

## Basic Usage

Run as a script to load test a URL:

    $ loadtest [-n requests] [-c concurrency] URL

The URL can be "http://" or "https://". Set the max number of requests with `-n`, and the desired level of concurrency with the `-c` parameter.

Single-dash parameters (e.g. `-n`) are designed to be compatible with Apache `ab`.
  http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/programs/ab.html

To get online help, run loadtest without parameters:

    $ loadtest

### Regular Usage

The following parameters are compatible with Apache ab.

#### `-n requests`

Number of requests to send out.

Note: the total number of requests sent can be bigger than the parameter, if there is a concurrency parameter
and number of requests is not a multiple of concurrency.

#### `-c concurrency`

loadtest will create a simultaneous number of clients; this parameter controls how many.

#### `-t timelimit`

Max number of seconds to wait until requests no longer go out.

Note: this is different than Apache `ab`, which stops _receiving_ requests after the given seconds.

### `-C cookie-name=value`

Send a cookie with the request. The cookie `name=value` is then sent to the server.
This parameter can be repeated as many times as needed.

### `-H header:value`

Send a custom header with the request. The line `header:value` is then sent to the server.
This parameter can be repeated as many times as needed.

Note: loadtest will add a few headers on its own: the "host" header parsed from the URL,
a custom user agent "loadtest/" plus version, and an accept header for "\*/\*".
Example user agent: `loadtest/1.0.0`.

### `-T content-type`

Set the MIME content type for POST data. Default: `text/plain`.

### `-P POST-body`

Send the string as the POST body. E.g.: `-P '{"key": "a9acf03f"}'`

### `-p POST-file`

Send the data contained in the given file in the POST body.
Remember to set `-T` to the correct content-type.

### `-u PUT-file`

Send the data contained in the given file as a PUT request.
Remember to set `-T` to the correct content-type.

#### `-r`

Recover from errors. Always active: loadtest does not stop on errors.
After the tests are finished, if there were errors a report with all error codes will be shown.

#### `-V`

Show version number and exit.

### Advanced Usage

The following parameters are _not_ compatible with Apache ab.

#### `--rps requestsPerSecond`

Controls the number of requests per second that are sent.
Can be fractional, e.g. `--rps 0.5` sends one request every two seconds.

Note: Concurrency doesn't affect the final number of requests per second,
since rps will be shared by all the clients. E.g.:

    loadtest <url> -c 10 --rps 10

will send a total of 10 rps to the given URL, from 10 different clients
(each client will send 1 request per second).

Beware: if concurrency is too low then it is possible that there will not be enough clients
to send all of the rps, adjust it with `-c` if needed.

#### `--keepalive`

Open connections using keep-alive: use header 'Connection: Keep-alive' instead of 'Connection: Close'.

Note: Uses [agentkeepalive](https://npmjs.org/package/agentkeepalive),
which performs better than the default node.js agent.

#### `--agent` (deprecated)

Open connections using keep-alive.

Note: instead of using the default agent, this option is now an alias for `--keepalive`.

#### `--quiet`

Do not show any messages.

#### `--debug`

Show debug messages.

#### `--insecure`

Allow invalid and self-signed certificates over https.

### Server

loadtest bundles a test server. To run it:

    $ testserver [--delay ms] [port]

This command will show the number of requests received per second,
the latency in answering requests and the headers for selected requests.

The server returns a short text 'OK' for every request,
so that latency measurements don't have to take into account request processing.

If no port is given then default port 7357 will be used.
The optional delay instructs the server to wait for the given number of milliseconds
before answering each request, to simulate a busy server.

### Complete Example

Let us now see how to measure the performance of the test server.

First we install `loadtest` globally:

    $ sudo npm install -g loadtest

Now we start the test server:

    $ testserver
    Listening on port 7357

On a different console window we run a load test against it for 20 seconds
with concurrency 10 (only relevant results are shown):

    $ loadtest http://localhost:7357/ -t 20 -c 10
    ...
    Requests: 9589, requests per second: 1915, mean latency: 10 ms
    Requests: 16375, requests per second: 1359, mean latency: 10 ms
    Requests: 16375, requests per second: 0, mean latency: 0 ms
    ...
    Completed requests:  16376
    Requests per second: 368
    Total time:          44.503181166000005 s
    
    Percentage of the requests served within a certain time
      50%      4 ms
      90%      5 ms
      95%      6 ms
      99%      14 ms
     100%      35997 ms (longest request)

Results were quite erratic, with some requests taking up to 36 seconds;
this suggests that Node.js is queueing some requests for a long time, and answering them irregularly.
Now we will try a fixed rate of 1000 rps:

    $ loadtest http://localhost:7357/ -t 20 -c 10 --rps 1000
    ...
    Requests: 4551, requests per second: 910, mean latency: 0 ms
    Requests: 9546, requests per second: 1000, mean latency: 0 ms
    Requests: 14549, requests per second: 1000, mean latency: 20 ms
    ...
    Percentage of the requests served within a certain time
      50%      1 ms
      90%      2 ms
      95%      8 ms
      99%      133 ms
     100%      1246 ms (longest request)

Again erratic results. In fact if we leave the test running for 50 seconds we start seeing errors:

    $ loadtest http://localhost:7357/ -t 50 -c 10 --rps 1000
    ...
    Requests: 29212, requests per second: 496, mean latency: 14500 ms
    Errors: 426, accumulated errors: 428, 1.5% of total requests

Let us lower the rate to 500 rps:

    $ loadtest http://localhost:7357/ -t 20 -c 10 --rps 5000
    ...
    Requests: 0, requests per second: 0, mean latency: 0 ms
    Requests: 2258, requests per second: 452, mean latency: 0 ms
    Requests: 4757, requests per second: 500, mean latency: 0 ms
    Requests: 7258, requests per second: 500, mean latency: 0 ms
    Requests: 9757, requests per second: 500, mean latency: 0 ms
    ...
    Requests per second: 500
    Completed requests:  9758
    Total errors:        0
    Total time:          20.002735398000002 s
    Requests per second: 488
    Total time:          20.002735398000002 s
    
    Percentage of the requests served within a certain time
      50%      1 ms
      90%      1 ms
      95%      1 ms
      99%      14 ms
     100%      148 ms (longest request)

Much better: a sustained rate of 500 rps is seen most of the time,
488 rps average, and 99% of requests answered within 14 ms.

We now know that our server can accept 500 rps without problems.
Not bad for a single-process na√Øve Node.js server...
We may refine our results further to find at which point from 500 to 1000 rps our server breaks down.

## API

`loadtest` is not limited to running from the command line; it can be controlled using an API,
thus allowing you to load test your application in your own tests.

### Invoke Load Test

To run a load test, just call the exported function `loadTest()` with a set of options and an optional callback:

    var loadtest = require('loadtest');
    var options = {
        url: 'http://localhost:8000',
        maxRequests: 1000,
    };
    loadtest.loadTest(options, function(error, result)
    {
        if (error)
        {
            return console.error('Got an error: %s', error);
        }
        console.log('Tests run successfully');
    });

The callback `function(error, result)` will be invoked when the max number of requests is reached,
or when the max number of seconds has elapsed.

Beware: if there are no `maxRequests` and no `maxSeconds`, then tests will run forever
and will not call the callback.

### Options

All options but `url` are, as their name implies, optional.

#### `url`

The URL to invoke. Mandatory.

#### `concurrency`

How many clients to start in parallel.

#### `maxRequests`

A max number of requests; after they are reached the test will end.

#### `maxSeconds`

Max number of seconds to run the tests.

Note: after the given number of seconds `loadtest` will stop sending requests,
but may continue receiving tests afterwards.

#### `cookies`

An array of cookies to send. Each cookie should be a string of the form name=value.

#### `headers`

A map of headers. Each header should be an entry in the map with the given value as a string.
If the value is an array, several headers with the same key will be sent.

Note: when using the API, the "host" header is not inferred from the URL but needs to be sent
explicitly.

#### `method`

The method to use: POST, PUT. Default: GET.

#### `body`

The contents to send in the body of the message, for POST or PUT requests.
Can be a string or an object (which will be converted to JSON).

#### `contentType`

The MIME type to use for the body. Default content type is `text/plain`.

#### `requestsPerSecond`

How many requests each client will send per second.

#### `agentKeepAlive`

Use an agent with 'Connection: Keep-alive'.

Note: Uses [agentkeepalive](https://npmjs.org/package/agentkeepalive),
which performs better than the default node.js agent.

#### `quiet`

Do not show any messages.

#### `indexParam`

The given string will be replaced in the final URL with a unique index.
E.g.: if URL is `http://test.com/value` and `indexParam=value`, then the URL
will be:
* http://test.com/1
* http://test.com/2
* ...

#### `insecure`

Allow invalid and self-signed certificates over https.

### Results

The results passed to your callback at the end of the load test contains a full set of data, including:
mean latency, number of errors and percentiles.
An example follows:

    {
      totalRequests: 1000,
      percentiles: {
        '50': 7,
        '90': 10,
        '95': 11,
        '99': 15
      },
      rps: 2824,
      totalTimeSeconds: 0.354108,
      meanLatencyMs: 7.72,
      totalErrors: 3,
      errors: {
        '0': 1,
        '500': 2
      }
    }

### Start Test Server

To start the test server use the exported function `startServer()` with a set of options and an optional callback:

    var testserver = require('testserver');
    var server = testserver.startServer({ port: 8000 });

This function returns an HTTP server which can be `close()`d when it is no longer useful.

The following options are available.

#### `port`

Optional port to use for the server.

Note: the default port is 7357, since port 80 requires special privileges.

#### `delay`

Wait the given number of milliseconds to answer each request.

### Complete Example

The file `lib/sample.js` shows a complete example, which is also a full integration test:
it starts the server, send 1000 requests, waits for the callback and closes down the server.
