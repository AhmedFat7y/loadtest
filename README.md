# loadtest

Runs a load test on the selected HTTP or websocket URL. The API allows for easy integration in your own tests.

## Installation

Just run:
    $ npm install loadtest

Or add package loadtest to your package.json dependencies.

## Usage

Run as a script to load test a URL:

    $ node lib/loadtest.js [URL] or [websocket URL]

To get online help, run loadtest.js without parameters:

    $ node lib/loadtest.js

### Advanced Usage

Add your own values for concurrency and requests per second:

    $ node lib/loadtest.js [concurrency [request per second]] ...

#### Concurrency

loadtest will create a simultaneous number of clients; this parameter controls how many.

#### Requests Per Second

Controls the number of requests per second for each client.

#### --noagent

Open connections without keep-alive: send header 'Connection: Close' instead of 'Connection: Keep-alive'.

### Server

loadtest bundles a test server. To run it:

    $ node lib/loadserver.js [port]

It will show the number of requests received per second, the latency in answering requests and the headers for selected requests.

This server returns a short text 'OK' for every request, removing request processing from latency measurements.

## API

loadtest is not limited to running from the command line; it can be controlled using an API, thus allowing you to load test your application in your own tests.

### Invoke Load Test

To run a load test use the exported function loadTest() passing it a set of options:

    var loadtest = require('loadtest');
    
    loadtest.loadTest({
        url: 'http://localhost:8000',
        maxRequests: 1000,
        callback: function(error, result)
        {
            if (error)
            {
                return console.error('Got an error: %s', error);
            }
            console.log('Tests run successfully');
        });
	});

### Options

This is the set of available options. Except where noted, all options are (as their name implies) optional.

#### url

Mandatory. The URL to invoke for each request.

#### maxRequests

Max number of requests to send.

#### callback

Function to call after the required number of requests have been sent.
