# loadtest

Runs a load test on the selected HTTP or websocket URL. The API allows for easy integration in your own tests.

## Installation

Install globally as root:
    # npm install -g loadtest

On Ubuntu or Mac OS X systems install using sudo:
    $ sudo install -g loadtest

For programmatic access, install locally or add package loadtest to your package.json dependencies.

## Usage

Run as a script to load test a URL:

    $ loadtest [-c concurrency] [URL]

The URL can be "http://" or "ws://" for websockets. (Note: websockets are not  working at the moment, patches welcome.) Set the desired level of concurrency with the -c parameter.

To get online help, run loadtest without parameters:

    $ loadtest

### Advanced Usage

Add your own values for concurrency and requests per second:

    $ loadtest [-n requests] [-c concurrency] ...

#### Concurrency

loadtest will create a simultaneous number of clients; this parameter controls how many.

#### Requests Per Second

Controls the number of requests per second for each client.

#### --noagent

Open connections without keep-alive: send header 'Connection: Close' instead of 'Connection: Keep-alive'.

### Server

loadtest bundles a test server. To run it:

    $ testserver [port]

It will show the number of requests received per second, the latency in answering requests and the headers for selected requests.

This server returns a short text 'OK' for every request, removing request processing from latency measurements.

## API

loadtest is not limited to running from the command line; it can be controlled using an API, thus allowing you to load test your application in your own tests.

### Invoke Load Test

To run a load test use the exported function loadTest() passing it a set of options and an optional callback:

    var loadtest = require('loadtest');
    var options = {
        url: 'http://localhost:8000',
        maxRequests: 1000,
    };
    loadtest.loadTest(options, function(error, result)
    {
        if (error)
        {
            return console.error('Got an error: %s', error);
        }
        console.log('Tests run successfully');
    });

The callback will be invoked when the max number of requests is reached, or when the number of seconds has elapsed. Options are:

### Options

This is the set of available options. Except where noted, all options are (as their name implies) optional.

#### url

The URL to invoke.

#### concurrency

How many clients to start in parallel.

#### requestsPerSecond

How many requests each client will send per second.

#### maxRequests

A max number of requests; after they are reached the test will end.

### Start Test Server

To start the test server use the exported function startServer() with a port and an optional callback:

    var testserver = require('testserver');
    testserver.startServer(8000);

### Complete Sample

The file lib/sample.js shows a complete sample, which is also an integration test: it starts the server, send 1000 requests, waits for the callback and closes down the server.
